This app is made by Sihao Lu. It offers a swift (pun!) method to detect whether a patient has stroke. Given the fact that the mobile phone is the first thing beside our pillow when we wake up, it is really crucial to have a quick diagnosis before it is too late.

This app detects whether the subject's face is tilted in order to reach the conclusion.
